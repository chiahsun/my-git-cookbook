== Rebase and Merge

Say your source branch is `feature/add_awesome_feature` and you want to rebase it on target branch, `main`, and merge to target branch

1. Squash your commits (For example, there are 7 commits after branch point with main branch)
+
[source]
git rebase -i HEAD~7

* Change branches other than the first to `s` (which means squash)

2. Rebase on your target branch (e.g. main)
+
[source]
git rebase main

3. Check out your target branch
+
[source]
git checkout main

4. Merge your rebased branch to target branch
+
[source]
------
git merge feature/add_awesome_feature
------
Since you already rebase your source branch, it would be fast-forward without creating new nodes.
